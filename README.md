# Flutter version used was 3.0.1

# Some explanations about the project
- The architecture used was bloc based
- The directories are organized by modules and there is a shared one which has some common objects (colors, widgets...)
- The reason cubits were used instead of blocs it's because they are simpler and there was no need for blocs
- The reason 'part of' was used across the pages is to have more small widgets instead of less big ones
